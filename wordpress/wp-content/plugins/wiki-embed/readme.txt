Wiki Embed lets you embed mediawiki pages in to your site, sites like Wikipedia

== Description ==

The Wiki Embed's intent is to help create a (http://wiki.ubc.ca/Resource_Management_Framework "Resourse Management Framework").

* no-infobox: Hide any infobox that appears on the wiki for this page.
* tabs: Replaces the sections of the wiki article with tabs.
* accordion: Replaces the sections of the wiki article with an accordian. This option cannot be used as the same time as 'tabs'.

Example;
[wiki-embed url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Example" no-edit no-contents no-infobox accordion]
