The very simplest of notepads for your Dashboard. 

== Description ==

This dashboard widget provides a simple notepad. The widget settings allow you to choose which roles can edit the notes, and which roles can merely read them. Version 1.30 also adds support for custom roles and integrates with the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/members/">Members plugin</a> for role settings.

You can display the contents of your notepad using a template tag and/or shortcode. The widget permissions apply to these tags as well: only users with permission to read the notes will see the notes on the front end. You can use `div#dashboard-notes` in your theme's CSS file to style the notes.

== Translations ==

If you would like to send me a translation, please write to me through <a href="http://sillybean.net/about/contact/">my contact page</a>. Let me know which plugin you've translated and how you would like to be credited. I will write you back so you can attach the files in your reply.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin directory to `/wp-content/plugins/` 
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to your Dashboard and configure the widget by clicking the link in its upper right corner.
1. To display your notes in a theme file, use the `<?php dashboard_notes(); ?>` template tag.
1. To display your notes in a post, page, or text widget, use the `[dashboard_notes]` shortcode. (To use it in a widget, you'll have to enable shortcode parsing in text widgets, if you haven't already. Add `add_filter('widget_text', 'do_shortcode');` to your functions.php file.) You can use `div#dashboard-notes` in your theme's CSS file to style the notes.
